\subsection{Cost model}
The cost of the system is divided into three types: operation cost, QoS cost, and migration cost \cite{WANG}. Among them, the first two are static costs and are generated independently at each time slot. The migration cost is a dynamic cost, which depends on the task transfer decision during the task execution.
